  abstract    = {Gradients can be employed for sensitivity analysis. Here, we leverage the advantages of the Loss Landscape to comprehend which independent variables impact the dependent variable. We seek to grasp the loss landscape by utilizing first, second, and third derivatives through automatic differentiation. we know that Spearman's rank correlation coefficient can detect the monotonic relationship between two variables. However, I have found that second-order gradients, with certain configurations and parameters, provide information that can be visualized similarly to Spearman results, In this approach, we incorporate a loss function with an activation function, resulting in a non-linear pattern. Each exploration of the loss landscape through retraining yields new valuable information. Furthermore, the first and third derivatives are also beneficial, as they indicate the extent to which independent variables influence the dependent variable.},

  abstract    = {Annually, approximately 12 million people worldwide suffer due to the misdiagnosis of diseases. To tackle this critical issue, a novel approach for early disease detection is proposed, encompassing conditions such as pneumonia, diabetic retinopathy, and more. Patients can assess disease severity based on the provided medical reports, enabling predictions of mild, moderate, severe, or proliferative stages. Leveraging deep learning models, this system empowers individuals to accurately predict the likelihood of these diseases. The primary targets of this model are patients and hospitals, benefitting from unique image processing techniques that ensure higher accuracy. Building upon the success of existing deep learning models for diabetic retinopathy and pneumonia, the proposed system holds promising potential for advancing disease diagnosis and improving patient outcomes.},
