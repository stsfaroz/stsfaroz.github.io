I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a focus on Generative AI, Deep learning, and Machine learning. The goal of my research is to create Artificial intelligence (AI) strategies for the Finance and Healthcare industries.

I work for [FirstSource](https://www.firstsource.com/services/artificial-intelligence) , specializing in AI Agents, Model development, and research. My focus lies in generative language models, computer vision, and analytics. Also, I'm a [Instructor at Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/user/salman-faroz/).

What i feel, AI mirrors neuroplasticity, adapting and learning like our brain. This aligns with Geoffrey Hintonâ€™s view that neural networks learn by adjusting their parameters, much like our brain forming new connections. As I continue to explore and innovate, I remain committed to making a significant impact in the Finance and Healthcare sectors, harnessing the power of AI to transform lives and create a better future.
